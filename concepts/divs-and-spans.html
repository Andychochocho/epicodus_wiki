      <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>
      <p>The &lt;div> tag is nothing more than a container unit that encapsulates other page elements and divides the HTML document into sections. Web developers use &lt;div> elements to group together HTML elements and apply CSS styles to many elements at once.</p>
      <p>The HTML &lt;span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.</p>
      <p>The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.</p>
      <p>Here's an example:</p>
      <pre>
        <p>&lt;div class="important"> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/h2>This is a header&lt;/p></p>
        <p>&lt;/div></p>
        <p>*** The div is specifying a class of "important" which should always be very specific and never vague. ***</p>
      </pre>
    </div>
