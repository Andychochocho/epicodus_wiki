      <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
      <p>Bootstrap is a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript code designed to help build user interface components. Bootstrap was also programmed to support both HTML5 and CSS3. Also it is called Front-end-framework. Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating a websites and web applications.</p>

      <br>Often, you'll work on a team where somebody else gives you some CSS and you have to apply the correct classes to your HTML to use it properly or you'll be given some CSS, but then need to make small tweaks to it, which is why I think it's so important for developers to understand at least the basics of CSS.</br>
      <br>Often, however, you might want to create a website that looks nice without spending a lot of time designing the front-end user interface. In that instance, front-end frameworks are very useful. Bootstrap is a framework that allows developers to quickly set up professional looking websites with minimal effort.</br>
      <br>Watch the Prototyping with Bootstrap videos from Treehouse to get started using Bootstrap.</br>
      <br>Then make a new webpage about a place you'd like to go on vacation using Bootstrap to style the elements on your page. Don't forget to create a Git repository, make commits regularly and push those commits to a remote repository on GitHub.</br>
