      <h1>Markdown</h1>
      <p>Many people think that creating a web page involves really complicated code that requires extensive studying to understand. This is not necessarily the case. We are going to learn a simple language called Markdown in this lesson that will let you create web pages really easily. But before we do that let's quickly go over what the World Wide Web is in a nutshell.</p>
      <p>The web is made up of mostly text files - like the ones you created to write your papers in high school - as well as some other files like images or videos. These files are stored on computers that are linked together over networks. When you put a web site's address into your browser, you are really just asking to see a particular file, or combination of files. We will go more in depth into how the internet works later, but for now, this idea should help you to understand how to create basic web pages.</p>
      <p>Markdown is one of the easiest browser languages to learn.</p>
      <p>Here's an example:</p>
      <pre>
        <p>The * symbol makes it bold:</p>
        <p>Ex: My dog is *really* annoying in the morning.<p>
        <p>Markdown: My dog is <strong>really</strong> annoying in the morning.</p>
      </pre>
