      <h1>Looping</h1>
        <p>JavaScript loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code - until a certain condition is met. When developers talk about iteration or iterating over, say, an array, it is the same as looping. JavaScript offers several options to repeatedly run a block of code, including while, do while, for and for-in.</p>
      <pre>
        Example One

        **WITHIN THE JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE**

        for (var index = 1; index <= 3; index += 1) {
          alert(index);
        }

        ((This will run an alert that will pop up three times counting from 1-3))

        **DESCRIPTION**

        Here's how the for loop works:
        The for statement takes three parameters: initialization, condition, and final expression.
        1. The initialization parameter lets you initialize a variable. In this case, we've
        initialized a variable called index that starts at 1.
        2. The condition parameter tells the for loop when to stop running. In this case, we've said to stop looping when index reaches 3.
        3. The final expression parameter says to add 1 to the index parameter after each time through the loop.

        Example Two (Using .forEach method instead of for)

          **WITHIN THE JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE**

          > var languages = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'];
          undefined
          > languages.forEach(function(language) {
            alert('I love ' + language + '!');
          });

          ((This will run an alert that will pop up three times saying I love html
          then I love css and then a last alert with I love Javascript))

          **DESCRIPTION**

          1. Setting the variable (typically as plural) as array of Html, CSS, and Javascript
          2. The output should be undefined.
          3. What this line is doing in step three is the function intiates the method (.forEach) with the variable (languages).
          4. Sends out a first alert with "I love HTML," then a second alert "I love CSS," and a final alert with "I love Javascript".
