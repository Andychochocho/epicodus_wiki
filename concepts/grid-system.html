      <h1>Grid System</h1>
        <p>One of Bootstrap's most powerful features is its grid system, which lets you create rows and columns on your pages.The documentation is all put in a &lt;div> with class row; the sidebar is in a &lt;div> with class col-md-3, and the documentation itself is in a &lt;div> with class col-md-9. Bootstrap's grid has a 12-column layout, and you can choose how many columns each vertical section of the page takes up. So you could divide a row up into 4 columns of col-md-3, or a column of col-md-4 and a one of col-md-8, and so on.</p>

        **WITHIN THE HTML FILE**
        
        &lt;div class="row">
          &lt;div class="col-md-6">Here is some content
          &lt;/div>
          &lt;div class="col-md-6">Here is some content
          &lt;/div>
        &lt;/div>

        **DESCRIPTION**

        As you can see there is two columns set with the number 6 within a row class. The columns in a row have to add up to a total sum of
        twelve, so if you only have one column then you would have to set the number to twelve.
