      <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name. You can change the variable to anything, even after it has already been set.</p>
      <pre>
        **WITHIN THE JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE**

        > var andrew = 5 + 7;
        undefined

        > andrew
        12

        **DESCRIPTION**

        In the given example we can see that I set the variable "andrew" to have the value of the sum of five and seven. When I call
        back variable "andrew" it comes out to twelve...the total sum of five and seven we set earlier.
